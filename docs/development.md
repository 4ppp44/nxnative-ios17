# Development

The README covers packing and playing. This page is for working on nxnative itself: how it is built, the script's options, running games on the Mac, adding a game, and per-game notes. Agent-oriented details (bring-up failure catalogue, graphics specifics, debugging recipes) are in [docs/agents](agents/README.md).

## How it works

| Part | State |
|---|---|
| Rewriter (`dm/tools/patch_nso.py`, `DM_RULESET=native`) | Runs unchanged on every module of every supported game. Per-build cuts are keyed by the module's build ID |
| Host (`dm/host`) | Stands in for the Horizon kernel and the system services the games call: threads and synchronization, memory, file system with transactional saves, HID, audio, movies (VP9 through libvpx, Vorbis sound through stb_vorbis), software keyboard, focus and lifecycle |
| Graphics (`dm/gfx`) | NVN on Metal. Shaders are extracted by `shader_split.py` from Nintendo's containers and from Unity's `Shader` objects, then translated offline. Mario: 16,266 of 16,268 shaders compile. Engage: 9,268 of 9,269 |
| Audio | Games that carry the SDK's audio renderer (Mario) run it in-process; games that use AudioOut directly (Engage: Wwise) feed it straight. Output goes through Core Audio (default on iOS, `DM_AUDIO=1` on the Mac) |
| Input | iOS: the touch gamepad and physical controllers. Mac: scripted input (`DM_KEYS=<seconds>:<button>,…`, with `DM_KBD=<text>` answering the system keyboard) or `DM_WINDOW=1` for a window with keyboard input |
| iOS app | One unsigned IPA for iPhone and iPad. The rewritten code is embedded in the executable; shader libraries and the game icon are inside the app; RomFS game resources remain external in Documents/romfs |
| Known gaps | Conditional render is always drawn; sparse virtual-pool mappings; `DrawElementsIndirect`. TBDR optimizations are off by default (they don't understand bindless textures yet). No amiibo. On the Mac, Mario's menu and dialogue text render blank (fine on the iPhone) |

## The packing script in detail

`scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py` (`-h` lists every option; outputs to `releases/` by default or custom path via `-o`):

```
# written to the Desktop with your own home-screen name
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/MarioWonder -k ~/keys/prod.keys -o ~/Desktop/Mario.ipa --app-name "Mario Wonder"

# pack Mario 1.0.0 instead of 1.2.1 (the folder still needs both NSPs: the shader tables cover both versions)
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/MarioWonder -k ~/keys/prod.keys -p v0

# keep the extracted game files (default in iOS 17 port: RomFS extraction is needed for external resource placement)
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/MarioWonder -k ~/keys/prod.keys --keep-extracted

# a diagnostic build with environment switches baked in (one KEY=VALUE per line)
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/MarioWonder -k ~/keys/prod.keys --env-file diag_env.txt
```

In Spyder, open the script, fill in the settings at the top (`NSP_DIR`, `PROD_KEYS`, and optionally `PACKAGE`, `OUT_IPA`, `APP_NAME`, `BUNDLE_ID`), and press F5. Empty paths are asked for at run time.

What the script does:
1. It finds the game profile from the title ID (the `[title ID]` in the file names, or the NSP's ticket; the update by its `[vN]` tag).
2. It extracts the NSPs.
3. It rewrites the code modules, checking each build ID against the profile.
4. It splits out the shaders and checks them against the profile's tables.
5. It builds the iOS shader libraries.
6. It calls `build_ipa.sh`.


## Shader translation toolchain & clean builds

The in-repo shader translator `dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_bin/dmsh_xlate.dll` is compiled deterministically with path mapping (`/p:Deterministic=true /p:PathMap`) to ensure reproducible, private-path-free builds. Its tool fingerprint in `dmsh_chain.lock` corresponds to clean chain version `8112c06188b4` for Super Mario Bros. Wonder (Title ID `010015100B514000`).

When building from source NSPs, the toolchain compiles shaders matching this clean chain. Note that the historical build `2026101906` test IPA was generated during local development under toolchain identity `10007be80c7c`; clean from-source builds generate full matching shaders directly from the user's provided game NSPs under the public toolchain.
Everything it writes stays in the NSP folder: intermediate files and logs in `<id>_build/`, the IPA next to the NSPs. The extracted game files are deleted at the end unless you pass `--keep-extracted`. It exits with 0 when done and 1 on an error. The app's bundle ID is `org.nxnative.<base game title ID>` (for example `org.nxnative.0100a6301214e000`); `--app-name` / `--bundle-id` (or `APP_NAME` / `BUNDLE_ID` in Spyder) override the name and ID.

On the device, environment switches go in `Documents/env.txt` (one `KEY=VALUE` per line), and game files are also accepted at `Documents/romfs`.

## Port another game

Each game has a profile in `dm/games/<id>/`:
- `game.tsv` holds the title ID, known builds, code modules, RomFS marker, memory split, NVN driver tables, app name and bundle ID;
- the shader tables: `shader_map.tsv`, `shader_facts.tsv`, `shader_pairs.tsv`, `c1_full.tsv`, `pso_manifest.tsv`;
- `dmsh_chain.h` holds the chain version.

The shader tools pick a profile with `DM_GAME=<id>`; `make -C dm/host` and `build_ipa.sh` pick it with `GAME=<id>`. Profiles are named after the base game's title ID. There is no default game: without `GAME` / `DM_GAME` the tools stop and list the profiles. `python3 dm/games/game.py list` lists the profiles. Host code that relies on one build's fixed addresses checks that build's ID.

To add a game:
1. Run `scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py` on its NSP folder. With no matching profile, it writes a survey to `<title ID>_survey/survey.md`. The survey covers the modules, SDK, engine, containers, rewrite sites, and the imports compared with the host's hooks.
2. Add a profile as described in [dm/games/README.md](../dm/games/README.md).
3. Bring the game up following [docs/agents](agents/README.md): extraction, binary survey, a catalogue of host bring-up failures, graphics, and debugging recipes.

## Build by hand (Mac)

You need the same tools as the script. The shader translator is the prebuilt `dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_bin`, the build that matches `dmsh_chain.lock`; a fresh `dotnet publish` gives different fingerprints. The commands use three variables:
- `G`, the profile;
- `W`, the game's work folder: `<title ID>-work` inside the game's NSP folder, outside this repository and off the home folder (it grows to the size of the game files);
- `VER`, a version folder named after the NSP version.

```
G=010015100B514000; W="<NSP folder>/$G-work"; VER=v327680
# 1. extract: the base game alone (update -), or an update layered over it (the last argument lets unchanged files become clones)
dotnet build dm/tools/nx_extract -c Release -o $W/build/nx_extract

# 4. the host, and the button-icon font for the Nintendo-extension shared font
make -C dm/host GAME=$G dmhost
python3 dm/tools/make_ext_font.py $W/build/font/nintendo_ext.ttf
# 5. run on the Mac

# 6. iOS shader libraries (about 15 min for Mario), then the IPA (default <NSP folder>/<the profile's ipa>)
IOSOUT=$W/build/ios/dmsh_b DM_GAME=$G python3 dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_build.py $W/shader/pkg $W/build/cache/metal_shader_cache
GAME=$G W=$W dm/ios/tools/build_ipa.sh [out.ipa]
```

Notes on these steps:
- `build_ipa.sh` takes the rewritten modules from `$W/build/patched_<package>` and the RomFS from `$W/data/<package>/RomFS`; `PATCHED` and `ROMFS` override them.
- It also bundles a standard font (macOS's Arial Unicode, `STD_FONT=` overrides it) and the generated `nintendo_ext.ttf`.
- The icon is the `icon.jpg` that `nx_extract` saves next to `RomFS/`; `DM_ICON=` points at another image.
- `DM_ENV_FILE=` bakes environment switches into the app, and `DM_DISPLAY_NAME=` renames it.
- If Xcode's Locations setting puts products in a custom place, the script finds the app through the build log.
- hactool cannot read every update (Mario 1.2.1's patch NCA gives "Invalid BKTR layout!"), which is why `nx_extract` uses LibHac.

## Prewarm lists

Metal compiles each combination of shaders and pipeline settings for the GPU the first time it is used. Each takes tens of milliseconds, so a burst of them on entering a level is a visible freeze. The host records what it had to compile and rebuilds those pipelines on a background queue at the next launch:

- `pso_user.tsv` sits next to the save directory: `Documents/pso_user.tsv` on iOS, the parent of `DM_SAVE` on the Mac (`DM_PSO_USER=path` overrides it). It is appended while playing, one line per item built on the spot: a shader (`S`), a render pipeline (`R`, the hex of `pso_skey` in `dm/gfx/nvn/nvn_pso_skey.h`) or a compute pipeline (`C`).
- `dm/games/<id>/pso_manifest.tsv` is the seed list bundled with the app, prewarmed before `pso_user.tsv`.

The lines name shaders by content key and hold no compiled code and nothing personal, so a list recorded on one device works on any other. To seed the bundled list:
1. Record on the Mac with prewarm off, so everything is built on demand: `DM_PSO_MANIFEST=off DM_PSO_RECORD=<file>`, playing the scenes players reach first. Engage's list covers boot, the opening movie, the title, a save load and the prologue battle.
2. Append the recorded lines below the header comments, in the recorded order. Duplicates are dropped at load.
3. Rebuild the IPA.

Record on the game version you ship. At launch the log names each list it read and its line count (`管线预热清单 … 行`), or says that `pso_user.tsv` does not exist yet.

## Game notes

**Super Mario Bros. Wonder (`010015100B514000`)**
- **Versions:** v0 (1.0.0) and 1.2.1 (v327680). With the update layered over v0, unchanged files become APFS clones, so the merged RomFS adds only about 114 MB to the 3.5 GB base.
- **Shaders:** 12,811 in v0 and 16,268 across both versions; the tables hold both.
- **1.2.1:** it is a new `main` build (SDK 16.2.12), whose resource-heap cut (+16 KB slack) was carried over with `dm/tools/nso_fnmap.py`. It also makes new SDK calls, which the host answers: `nn::nfp` finds no amiibo, `pl::IsRunningOnOunce` is false, the shop call is a no-op, and `account::PopOpenUsers` returns none.
- **Mac input:** `DM_KEYS="12:A,14:A,20:A,26:A,32:A"` reaches the opening course.

**Fire Emblem Engage (`0100A6301214E000`)**
- **Engine:** Unity 2020.3 IL2CPP, SDK 12.3.7. The shaders are read out of Unity bundles (`unityfs.py`).
- **Memory:** a 5 GB guest block, the total proven on a phone, with a 2.5 GB application pool. A per-build cut shrinks the SDK's address-region node area to 62 MB.
- **Audio:** Wwise drives AudioOut directly.
- **Movies:** VP9, decoded on the host.
- **60 fps:** the Switch version runs at 30; one patch to its code switches it to the 60 fps timing the game already has, so nothing runs too fast.

**The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (`01007EF00011E000`)**
- A patch to the game's frame-interval logic lifts its 30 fps limit to 60 without changing the game speed (it falls back to 30 by itself when a frame takes too long).
- The game waits for each frame's GPU work before submitting the next, so the host hands its translated commands to the GPU in segments ([04](agents/04-graphics.md)).
- **HUD prompt shadows and glows:** each prompt bar captures itself into a blurred mask the game keeps in the red channel of an R8 texture whose channel mapping says alpha = 1; the profile's `alpha_from_red` key makes every layout shader read alpha from red for such render targets, otherwise prompts sit on hard-edged dark boxes or cream cloud rectangles ([04](agents/04-graphics.md)).

**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (`01006BB00C6F0000`)**
- **Engine:** Grezzo's engine on NintendoWare, SDK 8.2.0 (the oldest so far), NVN 53. Modules main + subsdk0 (GLSLC, NVN's runtime shader compiler) + subsdk1 (movie) + sdk; 9,698 shaders from the bfsha archives, effects and layouts.
- **Window origin:** the only game so far that keeps NVN's default lower-left (OpenGL) window origin; the host flips its viewports and winding and the window image at present ([04](agents/04-graphics.md)). Before that, text the game renders into textures came out upside down.
- **Movies:** VP9 with a 5.1 Vorbis sound track; the host decodes the sound with stb_vorbis.
- **Lighting:** tiled forward lighting whose tile lists a compute shader builds each frame; it needs the dispatch size in NVN's driver segment `c0` ([04](agents/04-graphics.md)). Before the host supplied it, lights piled into the bottom tile row and the doorway step flickered with white tiles.
- **Sound:** SDK 8 numbers the audio renderer's commands differently (the output command is 0x10, not 0x13); the host recognises the output command by its size. Before that, music and sound effects were silent and only the movies had sound ([03](agents/03-bringup.md)).
- **Mac input:** the title wants L+R: `DM_KEYS="f6000:L+R~0.4,f6300:A,f6500:A,f6700:Down,f6800:A"` reaches a new file's name entry (a fresh save directory via `SV=`).
- **Frame rate:** gameplay runs at 60 like on the Switch; the game itself drops to 30 (present interval 2) for event cutscenes.

## Tools (`dm/tools`)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nx_extract/` | NSP → ExeFS / RomFS / icon with LibHac, merging an update over the base game (C#, `dotnet build`). `--manifest` writes ExeFS and a RomFS file list only, for surveys |
| `nso_fnmap.py` | Carries offsets from one build to another (function matching with addresses masked; globals via their references) |
| `nso2elf.py` | Converts NSO to ELF for Ghidra / REA |
| `insn_census.py` | Counts the instruction sites the rewriter must handle |
| `nso_syms.py` | Compares the SDK import surface of two games, or of one game (`-` for the reference) with the host hooks |
| `nvn_slots_got.py` | Builds the NVN fetch table and call sites (GOT-indirect loaders) |


## iOS 17 startup preparation and persistent pipeline binaries

The native launch page runs the union of the bundled `pso_manifest.tsv` and the
local `pso_user.tsv` before starting guest code. Progress counts unique known
manifest rows, not every pipeline the game could ever create. Shader loading,
render/compute creation, failed rows and unsupported recorded specializations
are counted separately. A partial result offers Continue; missing shader inputs
stop the startup gate. The legacy host-only background warmup remains available.

Traditional `MTLBinaryArchive` caches normal render/compute GPU binaries in
`Library/Application Support/NXPipelineCache/<profile>/<identity>/` on the phone.
The identity includes the renderer cache ABI, shader chain and tables, rewritten
module metadata, GPU identity and OS version/build. Compatible IPA build-number
changes alone do not invalidate it. Successful recipe replay still creates live
Metal objects on each process launch; PSO pointers and guest memory are not saved.

On iOS 17, functions declaring constants and explicitly specialized render
variants bypass persistent serialization. Their startup prewarming still runs.
Apple documents device serialization of specialized functions from iOS 18/macOS
15; the iOS 17 code does not assume that capability. Ordinary compilation is the
fallback when an archive lookup fails, is disabled, or storage is unavailable.

New runtime pipelines continue to be recorded in the local manifest, added to
the archive and saved after a coalesced 30-second delay. Preparation flushes before
publishing READY. Background entry requests a bounded UIKit background task for a
final CPU/file flush and pauses preparation at row boundaries; no GPU submission
is introduced by this cache. Writes serialize to a temporary sibling, check size,
fsync and atomically rename. Failed writes keep the previous archive and disable
further writes for this session. Maximum archive size is 256 MiB, with a 128 MiB
free-space reserve beyond a full-sized temporary file. After a successful save,
only the current and one previous hash-named archive identity are retained.

`DM_PIPELINE_CACHE=off` disables binary persistence without disabling manifest
preparation. `DM_PSO_MANIFEST=off` produces a partial startup result and allows
explicit continuation. `DM_PIPELINE_CACHE_DIR` is an optional diagnostic root;
host fixtures must set it explicitly. Neither setting changes saves or RomFS.
Inspect `Pipeline preparation`, `Startup gate ready`, and `[pipeline-cache]`
lines in `Documents/log.txt` for the real coverage and archive hit/miss results.
A16 startup time, storage size, stutter reduction, heat and iOS 17 archive behavior
require user device feedback. Compilation does not repair shader/texture errors,
remove asset-streaming stalls or raise sustained GPU throughput by itself.
